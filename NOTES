1. Parser -> Compiler - weird cyclic dependency
  - can we break it ?

2. Parser includes lexer - could we split it?

3. Is the order of checks in lexer the most efficient ?

4. Currently we skip comments - should we parse it explicitly?

5. What is a NodeId?

6. What is a BlockId?

7. why resolution works from the last ast node? maybe the ast nodes are added somehow recursively ?
